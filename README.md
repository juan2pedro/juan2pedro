# Hi, I’m Juan Pedro Mancera 👋

**Java Backend Developer** (Spring Boot) with 2+ years of experience building **REST APIs** in **microservices** environments.  
Based in **Málaga, Spain** — **actively planning relocation to Switzerland** (open to opportunities across Switzerland, especially German-speaking regions).

- **Core stack:** Java 17/21, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, REST, JPA/Hibernate  
- **Quality & practices:** clean code, unit testing (JUnit/Mockito), API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger), Agile (Scrum/Kanban)  
- **Frontend (supporting):** Angular / TypeScript — helps me design APIs that integrate smoothly with UI needs  
- **Currently improving:** Spring Security (JWT), Docker/Compose, CI/CD basics, architecture patterns (hexagonal/DDD)

## What I’m building right now 🚀

### Fitness App (Personal Project) — Full Stack (Backend-first)
A project to consolidate my Java + Angular stack and demonstrate end-to-end ownership.

**Backend**
- Spring Boot + JPA/Hibernate + PostgreSQL
- REST API design + OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Unit testing with JUnit + Mockito
- In progress: authentication & authorization (JWT), deployment, and UX improvements

**Frontend**
- Angular routing, services, reusable components
- Integration with REST endpoints

> If you want, I can pin the repo(s) here and add a short “Architecture & Decisions” section to showcase maturity.
